  Currently, I'm looking only for clients who are open to my fluid process of
  working. Art is an experience, not a destination. I have always created my
  best work when I have less requirements and restrictions on my creative
  processes. Shot lists and meaningless props get in the way of the true beauty
  that exists in a moment. For me, photography is a way to reach deeper into the
  experience. It's a meditation on that moment. Gratitude. If this sounds like

Currently, I'm looking only for clients who are open to my fluid process of working. Art is an experience, not a destination. I have always created my best work when I have less requirements and restrictions on my creative processes. Shot lists and meaningless props get in the way of the true beauty that exists in a moment. For me, photography is a way to reach deeper into the experience. It's a meditation on that moment. Gratitude.
